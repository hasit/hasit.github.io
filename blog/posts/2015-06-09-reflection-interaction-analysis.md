## CSS 590A: Special Topics in Computing and Software Systems
Approximately 4 months ago, I got an email from my Graduate Advisor that contained information regarding a potential faculty research opportunity under [Dr. David Socha](https://davidsocha.wordpress.com) on interaction analysis. Frankly, I had no idea about the research and the words 'interaction analysis' made little sense. But the work sounded interesting to me and the kind of dataset that Dr. Socha had collected was authentic and unique in nature. This drew me to pick CSS 590A for Spring Quarter.

The idea of research has predominantly been that of quantitative research in my head. Find enough occurrences of the thing you are trying to theorize, support it using hard facts and figures, and draw definitive conclusions based on numbers. It was only after the first class of CSS 590A that I was introduced to qualitative research. This side of research focuses more on answering the *why*s and the *how*s of the world we live in.

### The Research
Dr. Socha's research, aptly named as [Collaboration in the Wild](http://depts.washington.edu/citw/wordpress/), is about 'video ethnography to better understand how professional software developers collaborate on their actual work in their actual place of work' in his own words. This field of research specifically is relatively unexplored.

One of the reasons why I chose to pick this class was have an opportunity to work on authentic research. Apart from that, Dr. Socha's enthusiasm and energy was something I admire from the first day itself. This same passion kept me on track and interested throughout the quarter.

### The Dataset
The dataset at out disposal (called BeamCoffer) is unique in nature. 11 days worth of data consisting of 6 TB of video, audio, photos and screen captures was collected by Dr. Socha and his team. One thing to note here is that the dataset is multi-modal. This allows interested researchers like me to analyze the data using different channels. 

Another reason why this dataset is unique is because it captures software developers in their natural habitat. Prior research in the same field has been done in controlled environment or using specialized equipments. It has been established in human study research that the subjects of research behave differently in and out of experimental setups. This gives us the ability to work on completely authentic work and possibly contribute to the discipline of video ethnography.

## Gaze in Software Development
After initial discussions with Dr. Socha and my group, we decided to work on gaze. With only a very broad topic of gaze in mind, we spent long hours watching videos and analyzing gaze of the software developers at work. First few days proved to be difficult because the wide-angle action cameras used for recording has a slight fish-eye effect. This was especially difficult when we were trying to figure out the exact direction of gaze of the subjects. Hence, we decided to consider only the perceived gaze.

We  decided to focus on active conversations as our next step. Tracking everyone's gaze in a group conversation proved to be another hurdle. Hence, we settled upon pair conversations. A few weeks of watching videos over and over again and 'speed reading' other research papers, we started feeling more comfortable. This resulted in some very interesting revelations. Following are our observations:

- Categorization of gaze types - We found 3 types of gaze more prevalent in the dataset. Mutual gaze (both subjects looking at each other), Unreciprocated gaze (one subject looking at the other, whereas, the other looking away), Averted Gaze (both subjects looking away from each other).
- Alternating pattern - After careful analysis, we found a very peculiar pattern of alternating unreciprocated gaze among pair programmers.
- Averted > Unreciprocated > Mutual - Occurrences of averted gaze (around 95%) are much higher than unreciprocated and mutual gaze types.

Using these observations, we came up with a few more questions that we hope to answer in the future:

- Does Software Engineering context promote averted gaze? If so, does pair programming play a role in it?
- Are things like proximity and rank related to high occurrence of averted gaze?
- Is the alternating pattern of unreciprocated gaze related to types of roles the two subjects assume in their conversation? One of the most common roles we observed were that of mentor and mentee.
